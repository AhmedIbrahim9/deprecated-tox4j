/**
 * The network module is the lowest file in toxcore that everything else depends
 * on. This module is basically a UDP socket wrapper, serves as the sorting
 * ground for packets received by the socket, initializes and uninitializes the
 * socket. It also contains many socket, networking related and some other
 * functions like a monotonic time function used by other toxcore modules.
 *
 * networking_registerhandler()
 * is used by higher level modules in order to tell the network object which
 * packets to send to which module via a callback.
 *
 * Since the network module interacts directly with the underlying operating
 * system with its socket functions it has code to make it work on windows,
 * linux, etc... unlike most modules that sit at a higher level.
 *
 * The network module currently uses the polling method to read from the UDP
 * socket. The networking_poll() function is called to read all the packets from
 * the socket and pass them to the callbacks set using the
 * networking_registerhandler() function. The reason it uses polling is simply
 * because it was easier to write it that way, another method would be better
 * here.
 *
 * The goal of this module is to provide an easy interface to a UDP socket and
 * other networking related functions.
