/**
 * Ping(Request and response):
 *
 * The main DHT packet types are ping requests and responses which are used to
 * check if another node is alive and get node packets which are used to query
 * another DHT node for the up to 4 nodes they know that are the closest to the
 * requested node .
 *
 * [byte with value: 00 for request, 01 for response]
 * [DHT public key of sender, length=32 bytes]
 * [random 24 byte nonce]
 * [Encrypted with the nonce, private DHT key of the sender and public DHT key of the receiver:
 *   [1 byte type (0 for request, 1 for response)]
 *   [8 byte (ping_id)]
 * ]
 *
 * The first byte of a ping request is a 0. This is then followed by the DHT
 * public key of the sender and a nonce. The encrypted part contains a byte
 * with the value 0 followed by a 8 byte ping ip which will be sent back in the
 * response. The ping id is used to make sure that the response received later
 * is a response for this ping and not a replayed response from a previous ping
 * which would have allowed an attacker to make the ping sender believe that
 * the node they are pinging is still up. The ping_id is also used so that a
 * node can't just send ping response packets to the node in order to make the
 * DHT module implementation reset its timeout, it makes sure the node has to
 * actually receive the request packet before sending a response.
 *
 * The first byte of a ping response is a 1. This is then followed by the DHT
 * public key of the one sending the response and a random nonce. The encrypted
 * part contains a byte with the value 1 followed by a 8 byte ping id that was
 * sent in the ping response.
