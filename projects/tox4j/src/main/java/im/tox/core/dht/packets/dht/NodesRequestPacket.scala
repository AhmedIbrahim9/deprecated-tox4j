 * Get nodes (Request):
 * Packet contents:
 *
 * [byte with value: 02]
 * [DHT public key of sender, length=32 bytes]
 * [random 24 byte nonce]
 * [Encrypted with the nonce, DHT private key of the sender and public DHT key of the receiver :
 *   [requested_node public key (DHT public key of node of which we want to find), length=32 bytes]
 *   [ping_id (must be sent back unmodified by in the response), length=8 bytes]
 * ]
 *
 * Valid replies: a send_nodes packet
 *
 * The first byte of a get node request is a 2. This is then followed by the
 * DHT public key of the sender and a nonce. Inside the encrypted part of the
 * request is the DHT key that the sender is searching for or wants to find the
 * nodes in the DHT closest to it. This is followed by an 8 byte ping id which
 * is there for the same reason as the one for the ping request.
