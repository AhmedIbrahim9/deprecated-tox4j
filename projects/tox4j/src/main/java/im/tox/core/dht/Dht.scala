   * to each of the public keys in its DHT friends list (or list of DHT public
   * keys that it actively tries to find and connect to).
   *
   * If the 32 nodes number where increased, it would increase the amount of
   * packets needed to check if each of them are still alive which would increase
   * the bandwidth usage but reliability would go up. If the number of nodes were
   * decreased, reliability would go down along with bandwidth usage. The reason
   * for this relationship between reliability and number of nodes is that if we
   * assume that not every node has its UDP ports open or is behind a cone NAT
   * it means that each of these nodes must be able to store a certain number
   * of nodes behind restrictive NATs in order for others to be able to find
   * those nodes behind restrictive NATs. For example if 7/8 nodes were behind
   * restrictive NATs, using 8 nodes would not be enough because the chances of
   * some of these nodes being impossible to find in the network would be too
   * high.
   *
   * @param maxFriendNodes
   * If the 8 nodes closest to each public key were increased to 16 it would
   * increase the bandwidth usage, might increase hole punching efficiency on
   * symmetric NATs (more ports to guess from, see Hole punching) and might
   * increase the reliability. Lowering this number would have the opposite
   * effect.
   *
   * @param nodesRequestInterval The amount of time between each [[NodesRequestPacket]]
   *                             sent to a random node.
   *
   * @param pingInterval
   * The DHT pings them every 60 seconds to see if they are alive.
   *
   * @param pingTimeout
   * Nodes are removed after 122 seconds of no response.
   *
   * If the ping timeouts and delays between pings were higher it would decrease
   * the bandwidth usage but increase the amount of disconnected nodes that
   * are still being stored in the lists. Decreasing these delays would do the
   * opposite.
