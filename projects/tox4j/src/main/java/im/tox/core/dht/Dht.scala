/**
 * Toxcore stores the 32 nodes closest to its DHT public key and 8 nodes closest
 * to each of the public keys in its DHT friends list (or list of DHT public
 * keys that it actively tries to find and connect to) and pings them every 60
 * seconds to see if they are alive. Nodes can be in more than one list for
 * example if the DHT public key of the peer is very close to the DHT public key
 * of a friend being searched. It also sends get node requests to a random node
 * (random makes it unpredictable, predictability or knowing which node a node
 * will ping next could make some attacks that disrupt the network more easy as
 * it adds a possible attack vector) in each of these lists of nodes every 20
 * seconds, with the search public key being its public key for the closest node
 * and the public key being searched for being the ones in the DHT friends list.
 * Nodes are removed after 122 seconds of no response. Nodes are only added to
 * the lists after a valid ping response of send node packet is received from
 * them.
